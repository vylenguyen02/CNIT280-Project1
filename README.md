The Rescue911 Emergency Response Information System (ERIS)
Description:
As part of a cross-functional team consisting of a Scrum Master, Development Team, and Product Owner, I lead product development for the Rescue911 ERIS project. This system is designed to streamline emergency response operations for a rapidly growing ambulance and emergency services provider. The system will improve real-time dispatch coordination, EMT team management, and service documentation. Our work involves object-oriented analysis, UML modeling, and system implementation, all while following Agile methodology.

Key Responsibilities:

Analyzing business and user requirements through stakeholder interviews.
Collaborating with the Product Owner to ensure the system meets business objectives.
Designing UML diagrams (use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams) with the Development Team to align with system requirements.
Working closely with the Scrum Master to ensure smooth sprints and development cycles.
